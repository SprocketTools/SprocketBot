## Compartment Merging

```-bakeGeometry```

This command takes any compartments named "source" and merges their geometry into the "target" compartment!
** **
Start by naming your base compartment "target" - capitalization needs to match.  Then name all compartments you wish to merge into it "source" - these turrets must be connected to your "target" compartment.  Next, save your tank and run the command, with the _**vehicle**_ blueprint attached to your message when running the command.  Then download your compartment and move your source turrets out of the way!


## Geometry Manipulation

```-fixMirror```
This command rounds all the location data of your verticies to fix mirroring issues.  Rounding strength can be specified when running the command.
Run the command with the _**compartment**_ blueprint attached.

```-flipGeometry```
This command flips the geometry of your compartment along the Z axis.
Run the command with the _**compartment**_ blueprint attached.
