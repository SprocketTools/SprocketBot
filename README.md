# Sprocket Bot
### The best Discord Utility bot for improving your Sprocket Tank Design experience!
Sprocket Bot contains a host of various tools and utilities related to Sprocket Tank Design, including game help, contest management, scam detection and deletion, blueprint and decal manipulation, and more!

## Invite Sprocket Bot to your Discord server [here!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1137847253114040330&permissions=68169452355409&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

For documentation on Sprocket Bot's tools, check the [contest documentation](https://github.com/SprocketTools/SprocketBot/blob/main/CONTESTS.md), [anti-scam documentation](https://github.com/SprocketTools/SprocketBot/blob/main/ANTISCAM.md), and [utilities documentation (outdated)](https://github.com/SprocketTools/SprocketBot/blob/main/TOOLS.md).  To set up your own development environment, follow the [setup guide linked here](https://github.com/SprocketTools/SprocketBot/blob/main/SETUP_DEV_ENV.md).

## Important commands
`-help` - prints out a list of useful commands

`-SprocketHelp` - drops down a menu of useful prompts

`-setup` - allows the server staff to set up the bot

## Warnings
Sprocket bot is an **in-development** utility bot.  Its capabilities are changing quite rapidly, and is nowhere near the end result I want it to be in.  As a result, 100% reliability in its services is not guaranteed.  
- I cannot keep the bot's entire source code public once administrative utilities and/or vehicle rating formulas are added.

## Requirements
My responsibility for how contest hosts run their contests is extremely limited.  
Contest hosts may run whatever contests they'd like to with Sprocket Bot, except in the following circumstances:  
- The contest(s) violate Discord's TOS in rather blatant ways 
- The contest(s) cause excessive strain on the server or break it (which I would be impressed to actually see, no contest ever ran in Sprocket Official's history would have managed to do this *except the Ambushed! challenge*)

This doesn't mean I won't help to ensure the contests are set up as intended though.  Should issues like these arise, please contact me through Discord for fastest response.

## Contributing Code
Contributions are welcome!  Sprocket Bot is ran on Python 3.11.  
Setting up your own bot to run will require filling in data for the `configuration.ini` file and placing it into `C:\SprocketBot`.  Ensure that you have a PostgreSQL server to connect to as well.
