`-SprocketHelp` - drops down a menu of useful prompts
`-setup` - allows the server staff to set up the bot

## Contributing Code
Contributions are welcome!  Sprocket Bot is written purely in Python.  The attached .json files are usable as examples, and do not reflect the current campaign level.  It is recommended to use Github to download and update the files.

## Warnings
Sprocket bot is an **in-development** utility bot, developed by a college student during their free time.  I say "utility" because its capabilities are changing quite rapidly, and is nowhere near the end result I want it to be in.  As a result, 100% reliability in its services is not guaranteed.  
- I cannot keep the bot's entire source code public once administrative utilities and/or vehicle rating formulas are added.

## Requirements
My responsibility for how contest hosts run their contests is extremely limited.  
Contest hosts may run whatever contests they'd like to with Sprocket Bot, except in the following circumstances:  
- The contest(s) violate Discord's TOS in rather blatant ways 
- The contest(s) cause excessive strain on the server or break it (which I would be impressed to actually see, no contest ever ran in Sprocket Official's history would have managed to do this *except the Ambushed! challenge*)

This doesn't mean I won't help to ensure the contests are set up as intended though.  Should issues like these arise, please contact me through Discord for fastest response.
