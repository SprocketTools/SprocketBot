# Setting up a development environment to contribute code

Sprocket Bot is a complex project, involving many Python libraries, custom functions, and a SQL server.  This guide will help explain the steps needed to have your own development environment up and running.

Currently Sprocket Bot is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8GB of RAM - albeit it seems to only use 1GB of that.  Any PC that is viewing this webpage should have the specs needed to run the bot.

## Necessary software
- Python 3.11
- PostgreSQL 16
- Github
- Development IDE (I use PyCharm, VScodium should also work)

## Set up the development IDE

## Set up the PostgreSQL server

## Establish a Discord bot profile

## (Optional) Clone the SprocketTools repository

## Create the configuration.ini file

## Run the bot!
